# Earthquake_Mapping_3D

I have made this sketch using the P5.js library with its WEBGL mode, that allows the drawing of 3D objects on the canvas.
A large sphere with a map textured onto it represents the globe.
Earthquake data from 2020 to 2023 has been collected from the USGS earthquake database, and this data was used to visualize the earthquakes on a map.
The earthquake's latitude and longitude are converted to XYZ coordinates and balls are displayed to indicate the location and relative magnitude of the earthquakes.
The Globe is rotatable in both the X and Y axes, allowing for a complete view of any part of the earth.

Here is a demo:
